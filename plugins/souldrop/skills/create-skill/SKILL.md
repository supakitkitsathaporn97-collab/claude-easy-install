description: Interactively turns one workflow the user describes into a new installed skill. Use when the user says "make a skill", "create a skill", "turn this into a skill", "automate this", "teach my assistant to always do X", "always do it this way", "tạo kỹ năng mới", "làm tự động", even if they don't say "skill" explicitly.

# Create Skill — turn one workflow into a permanent ability

The manual sibling of `forge-skills`: the user describes ONE thing they want
done the same way every time; you author it as a skill and install it. Same
quality bar as the forge — hand-made and forged skills share one gate.

The user is likely a beginner. Never mention YAML, frontmatter, or file
paths unless they ask. Talk about "teaching your assistant a new ability".

## Step 1 — Understand the job (human questions only)

Ask, conversationally (use `AskUserQuestion` where options are natural,
free text otherwise), until you know:

1. **What** — the task, in their words. ("Reply to booking inquiries.")
2. **When** — what they'd say/do when they want it. These become triggers.
3. **Output** — what "done" looks like: format, length, language, tone.
   If they have an example of a good past result, ask them to paste it —
   one real example is worth ten adjectives.

Don't interrogate — 2–3 short questions is usually enough. Reuse what you
already know from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (their profession, language, tone).

## Step 2 — Draft the skill

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/SKILL.md.tmpl` as the shape
(always resolve via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — never a relative path; the
working directory is not this skill's directory at runtime):

- `name`: kebab-case, ≤64 chars, self-explanatory.
- `description`: THIRD person, ≤300 chars, pushy — what + when, with the
  user's own trigger phrases from Step 1 (in their language), ending
  "even if they don't say X explicitly".
- Body: imperative When/Steps/Output/Rules, grounded in their answers.
  Include their pasted example in the Output section if they gave one.

## Step 3 — Quality gate (same as forge-skills, all must pass)

1. `name` present, kebab-case `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, ≤64 chars.
2. `description` present, third person, ≤300 chars, contains a when/use
   trigger clause — and NO unquoted `: ` (colon + space) inside it, which
   breaks YAML parsing (use a dash, or quote the whole description).
3. Body: ≥10 non-empty lines, ≥1 `##` section, imperative steps, ≤500 lines.
4. Dedup: if `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` already exists, tell them in plain
   words and ask the human question: replace it, or name this one differently?

Fails → fix and re-lint (max 2 tries). Never install a failing skill.

## Step 4 — Preview, confirm, install

Show a plain-words preview: the ability's name, what it does, and what
they'd say to trigger it (NOT the raw file). On a yes, write
`~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and confirm in one line:

> "Done — NAME now knows how to <job>. Just say '<trigger>' anytime."

Mention that `learn-from-mistakes` will keep sharpening it as they correct
its output.
