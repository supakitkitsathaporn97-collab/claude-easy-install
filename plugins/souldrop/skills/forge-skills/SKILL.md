description: Automatically builds a set of custom skills tailored to the user's profession and goal, then installs them to ~/.claude/skills/. Runs automatically at the end of /onboard, and again whenever the user types /forge-skills, says "build me skills", "make skills for my work", "my goals changed", "tạo kỹ năng", "สร้างสกิล", "스킬 만들어줘", "生成技能" — even if they never say the word "skill".

# Forge Skills — auto-build the user's custom toolkit

Turn what you know about the user (profession + goal, captured at onboarding)
into 3–5 small, sharp, installed skills — **automatically, with zero technical
questions**. The user is a complete beginner; they never see the machinery.

Golden rules for the whole flow:

- **Never ask a technical question.** No questions about files, folders,
  frontmatter, YAML, or "skills" as a concept. If you must ask anything, it is
  a human question ("Anything else you'd love NAME to handle?") — and even
  that is optional.
- **Non-blocking always.** If any step fails (missing profile, unreadable
  file, a skill that won't pass the gate), say ONE friendly line and continue
  with what works. Never show a raw error. Never leave the user stuck.
- **Speak the user's language** (`LANG` from their profile / the session).
  Skill FILES are written in English internally EXCEPT the description's
  trigger phrases, which should include the user's own language so the skills
  fire when they type naturally.

## Step 1 — Load context (never re-interview)

Read what onboarding already stored:

1. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — the "About" section has their profession and goal.
2. `~/.claude/memory/about-me.md` — the interview answers.

If neither exists (forge run before onboarding), say in one friendly line that
you'll get to know them first, run the `onboard` skill, and stop — onboarding
will call the forge itself at the end.

## Step 2 — Derive 3–5 candidate skills

Two sources, merged:

1. **The domain map** — read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/domain-map.md`
   (always via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, never a relative path — the working
   directory is not this skill's directory at runtime). Find the
   profession row(s) that match the user and start from its candidate skills.
2. **Their free-text goal** — reason over the goal itself. The goal always
   beats the map: a photographer whose goal is "post more on TikTok" needs
   content skills, not just photography skills.

Selection rules:

- **3–5 skills, no more.** Each tightly scoped to ONE recurring job the user
  will plausibly do weekly (reply to an inquiry, draft a quote, plan a
  shoot…). Reject vague catch-alls ("help-with-business").
- Skip anything already covered by the bundled core skills (remember, recall,
  daily-note, work-smart, learn-from-mistakes, personal, leader).
- Names in kebab-case English, self-explanatory: `client-inquiry-reply`,
  `quote-builder`, `weekly-content-plan`.

## Step 3 — Generate each SKILL.md

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/SKILL.md.tmpl` as the shape. For each
candidate fill:

- **`name`** — kebab-case, 1–64 chars, matches the folder name.
- **`description`** — THIRD person, under 300 characters, deliberately
  "pushy": what it does + WHEN to use it, with 3+ concrete trigger phrases
  the user would actually type (include their language), ending the trigger
  list with "even if they don't say X explicitly". The description is the
  entire triggering mechanism — Claude under-triggers, so make it eager.
- **Body** — imperative instructions, under 150 lines: When to use / Steps /
  Output shape / Rules. Ground it in the user's real context (their name,
  business type, language, tone from the profile). Concrete beats generic:
  a real example inquiry-reply outline, not "be helpful".

YAML trap (real bug): an unquoted `: ` (colon + space) inside the
description breaks frontmatter parsing and the skill silently loads with no
metadata. Use a dash instead of a colon, or quote the whole description.

## Step 4 — Quality gate (blocks junk; never install a failing skill)

Lint every generated skill BEFORE installing. ALL checks must pass:

| # | Check | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | name present | non-empty `name:` in frontmatter |
| 2 | name format | kebab-case `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, ≤64 chars |
| 3 | description present | non-empty `description:` |
| 4 | description length | ≤300 characters |
| 5 | description voice | third person — describes the skill ("Drafts…", "Builds…"), never "I will" / "You should" |
| 6 | description trigger | contains a when-clause: "Use when/whenever…", "Runs when…", or equivalent |
| 7 | body substance | ≥10 non-empty lines, ≥1 `##` section, imperative steps |
| 8 | body length | ≤500 lines |
| 9 | dedup | no existing `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` (if exists: skip silently on auto-run; on manual re-run, ask the human-level question "want me to refresh it?") |

Also: frontmatter must PARSE as YAML — no unquoted `: ` inside the
description (see the trap above).

- A skill that fails → regenerate it (fix only what failed), **max 2
  retries**. Still failing → drop it silently from the batch; never install
  it, never show the user an error about it.
- Also dedup within the batch itself — no two skills with the same name or
  near-identical purpose.

## Step 5 — Install

For each passing skill, write `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
(user scope — resolve `$HOME` / `%USERPROFILE%`, create folders as needed).
Never overwrite an existing skill on the auto-run.

## Step 5.5 — Taste pass (only for design/content professions; silent)

If — and only if — the user's profession or goal touches **design, web,
landing pages, apps, social content, branding, or slides/presentations**,
also install 1–2 matching pro "taste" skills from the open-source
[taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill) collection
(MIT, © Leonxlnx — attribution already recorded in this repo's NOTICE).
A shop owner, teacher, or accountant gets NOTHING from this step — skip it
entirely; never install taste skills "just in case".

Mapping (max 2, prefer 1):

| User builds… | Sub-skill folder in the repo | Installs as |
|---|---|---|
| websites, landing pages, apps, UI | `taste-skill/` | `design-taste-frontend` |
| visual/brand design, slides, posters, social visuals | `soft-skill/` | `high-end-visual-design` |

How (non-interactive, silent-fail like everything else):

1. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill <temp-dir>`
   (use the OS temp dir; git is present — the installer ensures it).
2. Copy the chosen sub-skill folder(s) to `~/.claude/skills/<installs-as-name>/`
   (folder name = the `name:` in that sub-skill's frontmatter, listed above).
   Never overwrite an existing folder of the same name.
3. Copy the repo-root `LICENSE` file into each copied skill folder as
   `LICENSE` — MIT requires the notice to travel with the code.
4. Delete the temp clone.

If the clone or copy fails for any reason (offline, git missing), skip
silently — the forged skills from Step 5 are the main event; this is a bonus.
In Step 6's show-off list, present any installed taste skill in plain words
("an eye for high-end design"), never as "taste-skill" or a GitHub URL.

## Step 6 — Show off (this is the payoff moment)

Tell the user — in THEIR language, in the assistant's persona — what was just
built for them, as a short friendly list: skill name in plain words + one line
on what it does + an example phrase that triggers it. Shape (adapt, don't copy):

> "While we talked, I built myself a toolkit just for you:
> • **Client inquiry reply** — send me any inquiry and I'll draft the answer.
> • **Quote builder** — say 'quote for a full-day wedding' and I'll draft it.
> • **Shoot shot-list** — tell me the venue and I'll plan the shots.
> They're ready now — just talk to me normally. Say 'my goals changed' anytime
> and I'll build new ones."

Do NOT show file paths, YAML, or the word "frontmatter". If ZERO skills
survived the gate, just skip this moment gracefully — greet them normally and
mention they can say "build me skills" later.

## Re-running

Fully re-runnable (`/forge-skills` or "my goals changed"). On re-runs:
re-read the profile (it may have changed), never touch existing skills
without the human-level "refresh it?" question, and aim to ADD what's
missing, not duplicate what exists.
